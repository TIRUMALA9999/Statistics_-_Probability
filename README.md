## 📌 Overview

This repository contains **structured course notes on Statistics and Probability**, forming the **mathematical backbone** for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

The content is compiled into a single, comprehensive PDF and focuses on:
- Building **statistical intuition**
- Understanding **probabilistic reasoning**
- Supporting **model evaluation and decision-making**
- Preparing for **technical interviews and applied ML work**

These notes complement my **hands-on ML and Deep Learning projects** by providing the **theoretical rigor** required to explain *why models behave the way they do*.

## 🧠 Topics Covered (Detailed)

---

## 1️⃣ Descriptive Statistics

- Types of data: nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio
- Measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode
- Measures of dispersion: variance, standard deviation, range, IQR
- Shape of distributions: skewness and kurtosis
- Outliers and their impact on statistical measures

**Interview relevance:**  
“How do mean and median behave in the presence of outliers?”

---

## 2️⃣ Probability Fundamentals

- Sample space and events
- Axioms of probability
- Conditional probability
- Independent vs dependent events
- Law of Total Probability

---

## 3️⃣ Bayes’ Theorem

- Derivation and intuition
- Prior, likelihood, and posterior
- Real-world interpretation
- Applications in classification and decision-making

**Interview relevance:**  
“Explain Bayes’ theorem with a real-world example.”

---

## 4️⃣ Random Variables

- Discrete vs continuous random variables
- Probability Mass Function (PMF)
- Probability Density Function (PDF)
- Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
- Expectation and variance

---

## 5️⃣ Common Probability Distributions

### Discrete Distributions
- Bernoulli
- Binomial
- Poisson
- Geometric

### Continuous Distributions
- Uniform
- Normal (Gaussian)
- Exponential

**Interview relevance:**  
“When do you use Binomial vs Poisson?”  
“Why is the normal distribution so important?”

---

## 6️⃣ Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

- Statement and intuition
- Why CLT works regardless of underlying distribution
- Importance in inferential statistics
- Relationship to sampling distributions

---

## 7️⃣ Inferential Statistics

- Population vs sample
- Sampling techniques and bias
- Point estimates
- Confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing (null vs alternative)

---

## 8️⃣ Hypothesis Testing

- Z-test and t-test
- Type I and Type II errors
- p-values and significance levels
- Statistical power
- One-tailed vs two-tailed tests

**Interview relevance:**  
“What does a p-value actually represent?”

---

## 9️⃣ Correlation and Dependence

- Covariance
- Pearson correlation
- Correlation vs causation
- Multicollinearity (intuition)

---

## 1️⃣0️⃣ Applications to Machine Learning

- Bias–variance tradeoff
- Assumptions behind linear regression
- Probabilistic interpretation of classifiers
- Evaluation metrics rooted in probability
- Role of statistics in A/B testing and experimentation

---

## 🔄 How This Fits Into My Portfolio

These statistics and probability foundations directly support my work in:
- Machine Learning model evaluation
- Deep Learning optimization
- Generative AI reasoning
- RAG and Agentic AI system design
- Data-driven decision making

They enable me to **explain model behavior, uncertainty, and evaluation rigorously** during interviews.

---

## 🧾 Resume Bullet Points (Copy-Paste Ready)

- Built strong foundations in **statistics and probability**, covering descriptive statistics, probability theory, distributions, and inferential methods for data science and machine learning.  
- Applied **Bayesian reasoning, conditional probability, and distribution theory** to support model evaluation and decision-making in ML workflows.  
- Developed deep understanding of **hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance**, essential for experimentation and A/B testing.  
- Leveraged statistical principles to explain **bias–variance tradeoff, model assumptions, and evaluation metrics** in machine learning projects.  

---

## 🧠 Interview Talking Points

- “Statistics explains *why* ML models behave the way they do.”
- “Probability underpins loss functions, evaluation metrics, and uncertainty.”
- “I use statistical reasoning to validate models, not just train them.”
