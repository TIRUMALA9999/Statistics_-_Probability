## 📌 Overview

This repository contains **structured course notes on Statistics and Probability**, forming the **mathematical backbone** for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

The content is compiled into a single, comprehensive PDF and focuses on:
- Building **statistical intuition**
- Understanding **probabilistic reasoning**
- Supporting **model evaluation and decision-making**
- Preparing for **technical interviews and applied ML work**

These notes complement my **hands-on ML and Deep Learning projects** by providing the **theoretical rigor** required to explain *why models behave the way they do*.

## 🔄 How This Fits Into My Portfolio

These statistics and probability foundations directly support my work in:
- Machine Learning model evaluation
- Deep Learning optimization
- Generative AI reasoning
- RAG and Agentic AI system design
- Data-driven decision making

They enable me to **explain model behavior, uncertainty, and evaluation rigorously** during interviews.

---

## 🧾Points

- Built strong foundations in **statistics and probability**, covering descriptive statistics, probability theory, distributions, and inferential methods for data science and machine learning.  
- Applied **Bayesian reasoning, conditional probability, and distribution theory** to support model evaluation and decision-making in ML workflows.  
- Developed deep understanding of **hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance**, essential for experimentation and A/B testing.  
- Leveraged statistical principles to explain **bias–variance tradeoff, model assumptions, and evaluation metrics** in machine learning projects.  

---

## 🧠 I Points

- “Statistics explains *why* ML models behave the way they do.”
- “Probability underpins loss functions, evaluation metrics, and uncertainty.”
- “I use statistical reasoning to validate models, not just train them.”
